  {
    question: "How much does delivery cost?",
    answer:
      "The price of our service is optimized by distance, so the closer it is, the cheaper it is. If you use the Courier” category, the app calculates the distance between the pick-up point and delivery address and only shows the total delivery cost. If you’re ordering from one of the stores available on the app, you can see the item’s price beforehand. There will be a pre-established delivery cost depending on our agreement with the store in question, which you can see by clicking on the store. So before you confirm the order, you’ll know the total cost of the service. Occasionally, the price of the product may differ to what is shown on the app. If the price difference is less than 30%, Glovo will automatically proceed to buy the products for you. You'll be able to see the updated price once the courier uploads the receipt of the purchase. However, if the difference in price is over 30%, the courier will contact you to ask if you’d still like to proceed with the purchase. (For night deliveries, there might be an extra service charge applied to each item’s price. The amount applied depends on the city and store, and you’ll see this surcharge when you’re at the checkout stage in the app.)",
